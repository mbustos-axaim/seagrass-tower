seagrass-tower
==============

seaGrass is a project designed and built for the Burning Man 2013 festival.  It consists of a field of thirty-30 foot tall towers, each strung with 50 
full color LEDs.  Each tower is articulated to allow it to sway in the wind or react to other physical input.  

This code is responsible for managing each tower's computer which communicates with a central controller that coordinates the patterns displayed on the 
LED strands.  Additionally, each tower has a microphone and accelerometer which provide other forms of input that can be used to control the displayed patterns.

This code depends on http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html for building & deployment.
